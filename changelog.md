# Detailed Conversation Changelog: Creative Voice Agent Development

## Initial Context (Prior to Current Session)

- Set up environment for Creative Voice Agent
- Configured .env file with LiveKit credentials
- Resolved dependency issues:
  - Removed `livekit-plugins==0.2.2` due to unavailability
  - Updated `faster-whisper` to a more flexible version
  - Replaced `kokoro-tts==0.2.3` with `gTTS==2.5.0`
  - Installed `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` for testing
- Installed `ffmpeg` via Homebrew for audio processing
- Implemented STT unit tests with three passing and one failing

## Session: 2025-03-06

### STT Compatibility Fix

**Exchange:**

- **User**: [Implicitly requesting continuation of previous work]
- **Assistant**: Identified issue with failing test: `'async for' requires an object with __aiter__ method, got generator`
- **Assistant**: Examined `speech_to_text.py` file
- **Assistant**: Updated `transcribe_audio_chunk` function to use regular `for` loop instead of `async for` to support newer `faster-whisper` version
- **Assistant**: Ran tests again, all now passing

**Changes made:**

```python
# Changed from:
async for segment in segments:
    text_parts.append(segment.text)
    confidence_values.append(segment.avg_logprob)

# To:
for segment in segments:
    text_parts.append(segment.text)
    confidence_values.append(segment.avg_logprob)
```

**Test results:**

```
tests/test_stt.py::test_get_whisper_model PASSED       [ 25%]
tests/test_stt.py::test_transcribe_empty_audio PASSED  [ 50%]
tests/test_stt.py::test_transcribe_with_synthetic_audio PASSED [ 75%]
tests/test_stt.py::test_transcribe_with_speech_audio PASSED [100%]
```

### Kokoro TTS Implementation Discussion

**Exchange:**

- **User**: "https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M#usage - use this koko TTS"
- **Assistant**: Proposed implementation for Kokoro TTS:
  - Suggested adding dependencies: `torch`, `numpy`, `torchaudio`, `transformers`
  - Created scaffold for TTS service implementation
  - Described model loading, text processing, and audio generation functions

**Proposed implementation highlights:**

- Model caching with global variables
- Device detection for GPU/CPU optimization
- Text input processing with processor
- Audio generation and temporary file handling

### API Testing Documentation

**Exchange:**

- **User**: "how can I test the voice agent api in postman"
- **Assistant**: Provided comprehensive Postman testing guide:
  1. Server startup instructions using `uvicorn`
  2. POST request setup for `/audio/initialize` endpoint
  3. Required request body structure:
     ```json
     {
       "participant_name": "TestUser",
       "session_id": "test-session-123",
       "agent_config": {
         "personality": "friendly and helpful",
         "voice_id": "default"
       }
     }
     ```
  4. Response interpretation
  5. Explanation of WebSocket limitations
  6. Alternative testing approaches:
     - Frontend client with LiveKit SDK
     - LiveKit CLI for connection testing

### Changelog Creation

**Exchange:**

- **User**: "Create a changelog of this whole conversation"
- **Assistant**: Provided summary changelog
- **User**: "create a changelog of this chat in changelog.md"
- **Assistant**: Created initial changelog.md file
- **User**: "I mean build whole conversation changelog"
- **Assistant**: Created this detailed conversation changelog

## Next Steps / Pending Implementation

1. **Kokoro TTS Integration**

   - Complete implementation of text-to-speech service using Kokoro-82M model
   - Integrate with existing voice agent workflow
   - Replace current TTS solution

2. **Testing Infrastructure**

   - Create frontend client for end-to-end testing
   - Implement integration tests for complete voice agent flow

3. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation with new TTS capabilities
   - Document environment setup process
   - Create usage examples

## 2025-03-06

### Fixed

- Fixed compatibility issue with newer `faster-whisper` (v1.1.1) by replacing `async for` loop with a regular `for` loop in the `transcribe_audio_chunk` function
- Resolved failing test: `test_transcribe_with_speech_audio` now passes successfully

### Added

- Created plan for implementing Kokoro TTS (hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) for text-to-speech functionality
- Added Postman testing guide for the Voice Agent API
- Proposed additional dependencies for Kokoro TTS: `torch`, `numpy`, `torchaudio`, and `transformers`

### Tests

- All four Speech-to-Text (STT) tests now passing:
  - `test_get_whisper_model`
  - `test_transcribe_empty_audio`
  - `test_transcribe_with_synthetic_audio`
  - `test_transcribe_with_speech_audio`

### Documentation

- Created API testing documentation for Postman:
  - Server startup instructions
  - Request body structure for initialize endpoint
  - Response interpretation guide
  - WebSocket testing limitations and alternatives

## Pending Implementation

- Complete implementation of Kokoro TTS (hexgrad/Kokoro-82M)
- Integration of new TTS service with the voice agent workflow
- Frontend client creation for end-to-end testing
